* CacheHandler could be nice with a cacheHandler, if it can be done in a neat api. Or wrap the google cache? Or both?

## Features

* SessionAttachmentHandler perhaps with a delegate, based on undertow interfaces.

## Clients

* Build a descent DSL

## Other

Come up with a way to test stuff...
Allow https
Allow http2
Allow to set io/worker threads
